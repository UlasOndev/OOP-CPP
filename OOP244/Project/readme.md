# Disaster and Emergency Aid Management
This project aims to develop a comprehensive application tailored for managing the inventory and shipment of items to a designated area. The application boasts robust functionality, including meticulous tracking of item quantities, inventory levels, shipping logistics, and seamless data storage for future reference.

Within the realm of this application, items slated for shipment are categorized into two distinct classifications:

1. **Non-Perishable Products:** These encompass essentials such as blankets and tents, characterized by their enduring shelf life devoid of any expiration date. These products are aptly denoted as "Items" within our system.

2. **Perishable Products:** This category encompasses perishable goods such as food and medicine, distinguished by their limited shelf life and expiration dates. Within our framework, these items are identified as "Perishables."

In pursuit of our objectives, a series of meticulously crafted classes have been devised to encapsulate the intricacies of the problem domain and furnish an elegant solution. These classes serve as the cornerstone of our application, orchestrating seamless interaction and functionality to ensure efficient management of inventory and shipping operations.
